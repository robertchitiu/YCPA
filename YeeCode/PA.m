  Essentially what is happening in this code is that it is showing 
 and electric field and its resulting magnetic field propicating 
through some material. In this material there is a high.
 The boundary conditions set where the wave begins and how the reflect off
 the sides if they do or if they dissapate. Setting the BC to e mean that
 the sides will not reflect the wave. Setting ST to -0.05 raised the
 intensity of the wave making it much easier to tell what is happening
